## Personal Portfolio
This project was built with React, Vite, and Docker, and it's currently running on an old 2015 MacBook Pro. I upgraded it with a newer SSD, re-applied thermal paste, replaced the battery, and tucked it into the corner of my room.

Eventually, I plan to turn it into a basic cloud storage and VPN setup—hopefully without blowing it up. 💥😂
I try to refurbish and reuse as much as I can-- less e-waste, more good vibes for the planet. 🌍♻️

This project was bootstrapped with `npm create vite@latest`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `docker compose up --build`

Builds Docker images and starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, making the site available on port 3666 (or whatever host ports you’ve mapped).
